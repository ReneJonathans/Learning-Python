# Learning-Python
My first study in learning Python

A string is just a bunch of letters and words that we want to use in our program. We can use strings to say hello or write a message. Sometimes we want to put two messages on different lines. To do that, we use a special code that tells the computer to start a new line. It looks like this: "\n". It's like hitting the "enter" key on a keyboard. We can use this code inside our strings to make them look better. 

Here's an example of a string in Python:

```
my_string = "Hello, world!"
print(my_string)

```

This code would output:

```
Hello, world!

```

The variable `my_string` is assigned the value of `"Hello, world!"`, which is a string. The `print()` function is then used to display the contents of the variable `my_string` in the console.

To create a new line within a single string in Python, you can use the escape sequence `\n`. Here's an example:

```

print("Hello, world!\nHello, world!")

or

my_string = "Hello,\nworld!"
print(my_string)

```

This code would output:

```
Hello,
world!

```

The `\n` tells Python to start a new line within the string.
